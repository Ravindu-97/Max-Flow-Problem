# Max-Flow-Problem
This is a demonstration of an algorithm to find the maximum flow possible from a source vertex to a sink vertex in a flow network. Maximum flow problems find a feasible flow through a single-source (S), single-sink (T) flow network that is maximum. This problem is useful for solving complex network flow problems such as the circulation problem.
